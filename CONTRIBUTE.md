# Best practices before pushing code
-- First create a new branch with your issue number/name with git checkout -b "name_of_branch" 
-- Check if you have the same code that is there on the main branch with git status
-- If there are new changes on the main branch, git pull origin/main
-- Just to make sure you can git reset --hard origin/main
-- Do your changes and save them in a stash using git stash save -m "name_your_stash_if_you_wanna"
-- Do a git fetch --all and git reset --hard origin/main in case someone has made recent changes to the main branch
-- Then use git pop to get your stashed code back
-- Then do a "git add ." which will add all your changes
-- Then use git commit -am "describe your changes" and git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
-- Finally go to the repo and create a PR
-- Get it merged by a reviewer , you're good to go!
